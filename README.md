<h2>Anti-Aso</h2>
<h4>An Arduino-Powered Ultrasonic Dog-Deterrent made Fit for Household Use</h4>

<p>Okay so, long story short, mama wanted a way to ward off dogs with ultrasonic sound to reduce manual intervention for dog warding. Right now, I just made simulations. Pretty soon, I'll make it into actuality when I get the components and get to test it out in real life. For now, take these photos:</p>
